0.7.1 - Aron Preece:
      #Added in toolbox to new functionality.
      #Broke said functionality.
      #Listened to 1980s music whilst manically typing at the keyboard.
      #Added in changelog support.
      #Fixed a bug in which Toolbox>Styles wasn't showing.
      
      ! Unresolved issues:
      #cbxStyles refuses to get populated depending on what cbxShape's value is. Suggesting marriage counciling.
      #frmNew crashes completely upon start up due to two variables causing problems. Suggesting asking Josh "Why am I incapable?" 
      and waiting for advice.
